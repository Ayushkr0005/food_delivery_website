## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the app from Create React App

For more details on these scripts, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## 🧪 Testing

To run the test suite, execute:

```
npm test
```

This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## 📦 Deployment
